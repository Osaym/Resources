## WTF?
* These are random images and things which I find useful and relevant while coding.
* I have uploaded them to this repository for public access in case anyone wants to stop by, take a look, or even print
* **NOTE: I have NOT created ANY of the resources presented in this GitHub repository.**
* **ANOTHER NOTE: I am not responsible for any code breakage that results from the use of the images in this GitHub repository.**
* **LAST NOTE: I cannot confirm if the information presented in this GitHub repository is correct. Use with your own caution**

## OK
* Yes. That's all. Use these to your heart's content.

### *GOODBYE*
